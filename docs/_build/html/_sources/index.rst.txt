Welcome to PyGM's documentation!
================================

**PyGM** is a Python library for performing simple ray tracing calculations for the
plane grating monochromator (PGM) used in soft X-ray beamlines. Its main capabilities are:

- Performing ray tracing for a PGM with specified geometry
- Producing a beam footprint diagram as well as a side view ray diagram
- Calculating beam size given parameters about the insertion device
